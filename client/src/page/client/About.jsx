  const aboutRBIM = "Registry of Barangay Inhabitants and Migrants (RBIM) <br/><br/> The migration phenomenon is changing the landscape of Philippine society and its positive and negative impacts warrant serious consideration. Migration and development have always been interconnected to each other and at the core of economic and social development. <br/><br/> All these movements of people have been influenced by push and pull factors such as inadequate income levels in the area of origin, better jobs available in destination areas, easier mobility due to better communications and transportation infrastructure, and the increasing need for services. The impact of internal migration has always been an area of concern on regional development. The massive movement of rural population to urban areas and vise versa often exposes the local government units' unpreparedness for its effects. <br/><br/> Since migration is an equally significant population process for the local governments' planning, it needs mechanism to gather updated information. <br/><br/>The Commission on Population and Development (POPCOM) supports the tracking of population movement within the country by spearheading the development of the Registry of Barangay Inhabitants and Migrants database or RBIM. The goal of this program is to track internal movements of people from one barangay/municipality to another. <br/><br/> RBIM is a mechanism for tracking internal migration for purposes of development planning and policy formulation. Basic personal information of the respondents or household members together with their socio-economic profile are gathered. <br/><br/> Utilizing RBIM will benefit the users to have an advantage of more and better managed data that will eventually help to plan and provide basic services and facilities like schools, clinics, hospitals, jobs in the given area."
